    <h2>The Value of Money</h2>

        <figcaption>The value of money can be determined by the demand for it. 
        It can be measured by the amount of money that a person can buy in foreign currencies.
        The value of money can also change throughout the day. It can also be used to convert Treasury notes.
        When the demand for Treasurys is high, the value of the U.S. dollar rises.
        The second way is through foreign exchange. This is the amount of money that foreign governments keep on hand. 
        If they sell all of their foreign exchange reserves, the dollar would suddenly collapse.
        The value of the dollar declined from 2000 to 2011. It was mainly due to the low interest rate environment 
        and a slow-growth economy. Despite these factors, the US dollar has gained since 2011.
        The value of the dollar declined from 2000 to 2011. It was mainly due to the US' high federal debt and slow-growth economy.

        Producers pass along their extra costs to their customers. You can’t delay purchases when the prices go up.
        Time value of money has immense application in today’s life. Its application spans in a variety of personal 
        decisions like saving and retirement planning. Corporates investment decisions are based on time value of money.
        A dollar earned today is worth more than a dollar earned tomorrow since the dollar can be invested to earn a return.
        For example if the bank offers an annual interest rate of 10% in a saving account, then one dollar deposited will 
        become $1.10 in a year’s time. Time value of money exists due to inflation and preference of people for present 
        consumption. On account of inflation, you might not be able to buy the same amount of goods in future compared to 
        today as the purchasing power of money decreases due to inflation. People basically prefer present consumption
        compared to future. Borrowers must offer compensation for the postponement of the present consumption in the form 
        of interest rate on savings. This interest rate is called real rate of interest. Nominal interest rate includes real 
        rate of interest and expected inflation. In time value of money, money can be invested to earn a return which is termed
        discount rate.</figcaption>

    <h2>GMO food</h2>

        <figcaption>It’s human nature, it seems, to resist change and fear the unknown. So it is no surprise that genetic engineering of food and feed crops resulted in their resounding condemnation as “Frankenfoods” by many consumers, who seem as terrified of eating an apple with an added anti-browning gene or a pink pineapple genetically enriched with the antioxidant lycopene as I am of self-driving cars.

Trek down the grocery aisles of any large market and you’ll find many products prominently labeled “No G.M.O.s.” It’s much harder to spot the small print on many other foods stating “Partially produced with genetic engineering,” a result of a 2016 federal law that mandated uniform labeling of all food products containing genetically engineered ingredients.

The labeling requirement arose in response to public pressure and a confusing array of state rules. But while I endorse the public’s right to know and honest labeling of all products, in an important way it is very misleading. Farmers and agricultural scientists have been genetically engineering the foods we eat for centuries through breeding programs that result in large and largely uncontrolled exchanges of genetic material. What many consumers may not realize: For many decades, in addition to traditional crossbreeding, agricultural scientists have used radiation and chemicals to induce gene mutations in edible crops in attempts to achieve desired characteristics.

Modern genetic engineering differs in two ways: Only one or a few new genes with a known function are introduced into a crop, and sometimes the new genes come from an unrelated species. Thus, a gene meant to instill frost tolerance into, say, spinach, might come from a fish that lives in icy waters.</figcaption>

    <h2>The View of World in 2100</h2>
    <figure class="world">
        <img src="/img/2100.jpg" alt=""/>
        <figcaption>As time goes by, humans always find a way evolve.
        The world is changing, and changing fast. Technology, education, health, eating habits, dress - there is hardly anything in life that is not changing, some changes we like, while others create fear and anxiety.

Everywhere there is a feeling of insecurity. What will happen to us tomorrow, or what will happen to our children, are questions we keep frequently asking. One thing, however, is clear. It is no more possible to live in the way we have been living so far. It seems that now the entire fabric of life will have to be changed. Life will have to be redesigned. The life of the individual, the social structure, and governance—all will have to be replanned.

One of the greatest changes that has taken place lies in the political sphere. The age of Rajas and Maharajas has gone forever. No more are the landlords too. The other great change that has taken place is that every adult man or woman, rich or poor, high-caste or low- caste, has now a vote. All adults are entitled to vote and participate equally in forming their government. Thus, politically, we are all equal.
Earth's climate has changed throughout history. Just in the last 650,000 years there have been seven cycles of glacial advance and retreat, with the abrupt end of the last ice age about 11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era — and of human civilization. Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth’s orbit that change the amount of solar energy our planet receives.
Since the beginning of the century, the scientific community has been warning of the consequences for our planet of rising temperatures due to rising greenhouse emissions. We are already experiencing the effects of global warming. How devastating they are is in our hands. In what climate scenario do we want to see ourselves at the end of the century?</figcaption>
